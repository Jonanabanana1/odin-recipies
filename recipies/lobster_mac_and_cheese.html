    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni
        in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the
        bite, about 8 minutes. Reserve 2 cups hot pasta water, then drain
        macaroni in a colander set in the sink. Rinse with cold water to cool;
        set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour reserved pasta water into the same pot and add lobster halves,
        cut-side up. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and
        steam until lobster meat firms and turns opaque, about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove lobster to a tray and cool for a few minutes, then remove lobster
        meat and cut into bite-sized pieces. Reserve shells.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir
        onion in hot butter until onion is softened and translucent, about 5
        minutes. Remove onions to a small bowl; set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place reserved lobster shells, milk, shallot, peppercorns, and garlic
        into the same saucepan. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat and
        cook for 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Melt remaining 5 tablespoons butter in a separate saucepan over
        medium-low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until mixture turns pasty and
        light golden brown, about 10 minutes. Strain milk mixture through a mesh
        sieve and slowly pour into flour mixture while whisking. Bring to a
        simmer over medium heat; cook and stir until thick and smooth, 10 to 15
        minutes. Remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir Gruyère, Cheddar, and Romano cheeses into thickened milk mixture
        until melted and smooth. Season with salt and pepper, then stir in
        reserved lobster meat, onions, and macaroni.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour mixture into a 4-quart casserole dish and smooth the top. Sprinkle
        evenly with panko crumbs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until sauce is bubbly and the top is golden
        brown, 8 to 12 minutes.
      </li>
