    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These do be onion ringing</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 large Vidalia or other sweet onion</li>
      <li>1 quart oil for frying</li>
      <li>1.25 cups all-purpose flower</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup milk, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>.75 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
      <li>1/8 teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni
        in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the
        bite, about 8 minutes. Reserve 2 cups hot pasta water, then drain
        macaroni in a colander set in the sink. Rinse with cold water to cool;
        set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Slice onion into 1/4-inch-thick rings. Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365
        degrees F (185 degrees C). Place a wire rack over a sheet of aluminum
        foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare breading station by setting out 3 wide, shallow dishes. Whisk
        flour, baking powder, and salt together in the first dish. Whisk milk
        and egg together in the second dish. Place bread crumbs in the third
        dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip each onion ring into the flour mixture, turning several times until
        fully coated with flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer to the egg mixture and use a fork to turn until coated. Lift
        onion with the fork and shake gently so excess liquid drips back into
        the dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place onion in the bread crumbs and turn several times to coat, scooping
        crumbs over the ring if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lift again with the fork, tap any excess bread crumbs back into the
        dish, and place on the wire rack while you prepare the remaining onion
        rings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deep-fry 3 to 4 onion rings at a time in the preheated oil until golden
        brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on paper towels while you deep-fry the
        remaining rings.
      </li>
      <li>Sprinkle with seasoning salt before serving.</li>
